# Predicting errors in free-throw shots

In this project, we are trying to build a model that predicts how far from the hoop does a basketball land, based on features right at throw initiation. 

The goal is to make this prediction much before the actual data is available to the shooter. This instantaneous feedback might improve learning in this motor skill task
